# MineCryptoOnWifiRouter
 
 
 This is a small Tutorial that shows you how to mine DuinoCoin on a wifi router.  <a href="https://duinocoin.com">DuinoCoin</a> is a crypto that can even be mined on such low power devices.
 
 I made a detailed video. Read the description. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmaWwalQHnc=22" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmaWwalQHnc</a>
 
1. Flash the router you want to use with  <a href="https://openwrt.org">Openwrt</a> . There many guides for your specific router out there. This will void your Warranty!
 If you want to buy a router in purpose I wouldt recomemnd a tplink. You can flash them very easely and theyre cheap.
2. SSH into your router. Under Linux run: "ssh root@[routerip]. Under Windows use Putty. The default port 22 is fine.
3. type: "opkg update", "opkg install python3" and "opkg install coreutils-nohup" to install python and nohup.
4. Now edit the led names in the script. Also change Pichi to your username. There comments.
5. Now use a program like winscp to get the miner.py script onto your router.
6. Then go back to ssh and type "python3 miner.py".
7. If everything seems to work, and the router is mining, press Ctrl + c and type "nohup python3 miner.py &". If it doesnt, open a issue.
8. Thats it! Your router is now mining crypto! Happy Mining!
